                        <h2>Dexterity Coffee Labels</h2>
                        <p>Dexterity Coffee contacted the company I work for to create a label that would make her homemade cold brew coffee more official. We created a label and a logo to match the art deco vibe the client requested, using navy text paired with an off-white, cream background.

                        <p>For this school assignment, we were tasked to create bookmarks related to Las Vegas material found in the UNLV Special Collections. I referenced three different old school menus and repurposed them into a more modern take. The tassel and bead decoration paid homage to a classic decoration.

                        <p>Patch Daily is a vitamin patch company, and asked us to create packaging for the 4 different types of patches they currently produce. The client wanted the design to be appealing to all ages and stand out from competitors, so I designed the packaging with bright colors and an approachable typeface.

                        <h2>Lyric Poster Assignment</h2>
                        <p>This assignment was based off of bedroom pop singer Clairo’s charmingly soft song, “Flaming Hot Cheetos.” For this school project, I emulated the song’s gentle vibes with whimsical doodles and a soft pink that could be seen throughout the actual music video to tie into the gentleness of the song.

                        <p>This poster was created for a school assignment where we were tasked with creating promotional material for an imaginary World Cinema Competition. We were given a creative brief to work with that included basic information about the client, target audience, goals, and preferences as the foundation of the project.

                        <h2>Typography Short Animation</h2>
                        <p>This school assignment was designed for us to create a short type animation in Adobe After Effects. I decided to make the text "rain" rockets, referencing an ability from a video game. The rockets were made frame by frame, while the text changes were done in After Effects. When watching the video, right click and set it to loop for the full effect.</p>

                    <p>This map was included in the pamphlet to help con-goers navigate LVL Up Expo, a video game convention. I was given a blueprint of the convention space with the booths, and based the map off of popular Battle Royale games like Fortnite and Apex Legends to stick to the theme.

                        <p>This entire convention guide was created in InDesign and handed out to the conventions thousands of attendees.

                        <p>These badges were created for the 2019 LVL Up Expo Convention. As the first piece created for the convention media, these badges set the design theme for all future media. This year's theme featured glitched text and hexagonal patterns in the background to play on technology.

                    <p>This trifold brochure was requested by Willoughby Schulman, a past logo client. The trifold was designed to be kept in the glove compartment of cars and contains information and a checklist on how to handle an automotive collision.

                        <p>The Vegas Typography Poster assignment had only two requirements: relate to Las Vegas and use only type to create forms. I based my poster off of playing cards, as they have an essential role in casinos. Using the high contrast font Lust, I created a design that represented the Queen of Hearts.
